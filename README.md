# A practical introduction to colormaps in Python

This the code that accompanies the medium tutorial on colormaps in python.

### Requirements:
- Python
- Jupyter notebook
- matplotlib
- scipy/pandas/numpy
- fiona/shapely/descartes (for geographic data)

### Introduction
This notebook gives a practical introduction to using colors in graphics in Python. The matplotlib package has excellent support for managing colors and plots, however, it can sometimes be a bit tricky to find out how to combine the various different classes and in this package. The `color_map_tutorial.ipynb` notebook gives a practical introduction with examples.

### Getting started
Open the notebook `color_map_tutorial.ipynb` in Jupyter.
All the data you need to run this notebook is included in the repo.

If you want to have look at the pre-processing I did on the original data, look at `data_preprocessing.ipynb`. To run that notebook, you'll need to follow the instructions in the notebook to download the raw data (~5GB).
